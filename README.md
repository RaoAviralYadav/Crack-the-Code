# 🤖 Human-like AI Chatbot | ML + NLP Powered Assistant

Welcome to my **AI Chatbot** — a smart, multi-functional, and human-like assistant built using **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and a pinch of chaos (aka custom logic). This isn’t just another “Hello World” bot — this one **talks, listens, acts, and obeys like a digital genie**.

## 🧠 Features

- 💬 **Human-like Conversations**  
  Trained with NLP to understand natural speech and respond in a conversational tone — like you’re talking to a buddy, not a bot.

- 🧭 **System Navigation**  
  Open folders, launch apps, explore files — your personal system navigator is here.

- 📧 **Email Assistant**  
  Compose and send emails through voice or text commands.

- 🔍 **Web Interaction**  
  - Search Google with your queries  
  - Open YouTube and play videos  
  - Search the web like a pro

- 🎵 **Entertainment Mode**  
  Play music, stream movies, or vibe to your playlist — just ask.

- 🗣️ **Multi-language Support**  
  Can talk back to you in your language (limited by training set & voice engine).

- 🛌 **System Commands**  
  Can sleep, shut down, restart, or even (yep) delete files at your command — *handle with care* 👀
